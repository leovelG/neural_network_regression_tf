# neural_network_regression_tf
This is a TensorFlow guide that contains the following: 

1. **Creating a model** - define the input and output layers, as well as the hidden layers of a deep learning model 
2. **Compiling a model** - define the loss funcition( in other word, the function which tells our model how grong it is) and the optimizer (tells our model how to improve the patterns it's learning) and evaluation metrics (what we can use to interpret the performance of our model). 
3. **Fitting a model** - letting the model try to find patterns between X&Y (features and labels) 

This is a notebook that was made following the Andrei Neagoie course on zerotomastery.
